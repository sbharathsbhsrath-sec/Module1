# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

```
## Output
<img width="1562" height="988" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a17589-6afc-4918-aee0-2f5961c1bbdf" />

## Result
The program successfully reads a string from the user using the input() function, assigns it to the variable men_stepped_on_the_moon, and prints it as required.
